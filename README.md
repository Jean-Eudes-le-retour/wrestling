# ICRA Simulated Humanoid Robot Wrestling Competition

The competition focuses on the development of advanced humanoid robot control software for a wrestling game. It relies on a calibrated simulation model of the NAO robot, running in the Webots simulator with realistic physics, sensor and actuator simulation. Being spectacular and fairly easy to get started with, this competition aims at gathering a large number of competitors, both on-site and remotely. The fully open-source competition software stack was designed to be re-used as a template for other simulation-based robot competitions.
