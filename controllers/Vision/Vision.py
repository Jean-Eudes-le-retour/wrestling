"""
Controller example for the Robot Wrestling Tournament.
David beats Charlie by getting up after being knocked down.
Demonstrates how to use a sensor, here an accelerometer to detect a fall.
Depending on the fall direction, the robot will play a different motion, which is implemented by a simple Finite State Machine.
